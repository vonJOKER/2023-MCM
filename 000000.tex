\subsection{Our Work}
Previous research in this area has been very in-depth, and domestic research on the social stability index system is endless. Only then can we use its research results to solve the problems we encounter. Here's our work:

There is no substitute for the role of the media in regime change, and its entry into and occupation of a country's position of public opinion can help to bring down that country's regime.

% \item Keep a firm grip on the local media to prevent public opinion from getting out of control. There is no substitute for the role of the media in regime change, and its entry into and occupation of a country's position of public opinion can help to bring down that country's regime. For the ruling party, therefore, to give ground. That means the beginning of the loss of power, public opinion out of control, not much time.
% \item Legislation restricting the activities of NGOs in the country. On November 23, 2005, the Russian Duma adopted a draft law on non-governmental organizations inside and outside Russia, "According to this bill, non-governmental organizations in Russia are not allowed to accept foreign funds to engage in political activities, and foreign non-governmental organizations cannot fund non-governmental organizations in Russia to engage in political activities, and will clean, rectify, and restrain the behavior of informal organizations at home and abroad by means of registration, review of charters, supervision of the source and flow of funds, and inspection of whether the activities of non-governmental organizations are consistent with their purposes.
% \item It is necessary to handle the relationship with the opposition well. In the tactics of dealing with the opposition, countries that are not very tense in partisanship generally use the strategy of both unity and struggle. Kazakhstan, for example, on the one hand, has taken harsh measures against the excesses of some hardline opposition parties that disturb social order. On the other hand, ``in his address to Parliament in September 2005, the President stated that Kazakhstan planned to establish a 'State Commission for the Elaboration and Refinement of a Programme of Democratic Reform' under the direct authority of the President and to invite all political parties, public associations and non-governmental organizations to participate in order to expand the space for the opposition's political participation''.
% \item Strengthen control over powerful departments such as the military and police. The inaction of the military, especially the police force and the internal guard forces, when the ``color revolution'' took place, was actually a disguised ``initiative'', that is, supporting the opposition's attack on the current regime with actual actions.
